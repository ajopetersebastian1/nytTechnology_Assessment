## Getting Started

The New York Times offers a Developer API Portal, which allows developers to access and use the data from the newspaper's archives, including articles, reviews, photos, and more. The API provides a wide range of functionality, including search and filtering, content retrieval, and data analysis. Developers can use the API to build applications, integrate data into their websites, or perform data analysis. The New York Times Developer API offers a wide range of endpoints and is accessible via RESTful HTTP requests, with data returned in JSON format. The API is available to developers for free with certain limitations, and there are paid plans available for higher usage limits and more features. The New York Times also offers extensive documentation, sample code, and a developer forum to assist developers with using the API.

### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- base/
|- constants/
|- helpers/
|- stores/
|- screens/
|- widgets/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- base - Contains the bae controller and base view.
2- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `theme`, `dimentions`, `api endpoints`, `preferences` and `strings`.
3- helpers - Contains the helpers for format the date and time 
4- screens‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains all the ui of your project, contains sub directory for each screen.
5- widgets‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc.
6- routes.dart‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThis file contains all the routes for your application.
7- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```


### Routes

This file contains all the routes for your application.

```dart
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:nytimes/screens/news_det_screen/binding/news_det_binding.dart';
import 'package:nytimes/screens/news_det_screen/news_det_screen.dart';
import 'package:nytimes/screens/news_screen/binding/news_binding.dart';
import 'package:nytimes/screens/news_screen/news_screen.dart';

const newsScreen = '/news-screen';
const newsDetScreen = '/news-det-screen';
final routes = [
  GetPage(
    name: newsScreen,
    page: () => const NewsScreen(),
    binding: NewsArticlesBinding(),
  ),
    GetPage(
    name: newsDetScreen,
    page: () =>  NewsDetScreen( ),
    binding: NewsDetBinding(),
  ),
];

```

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get/get_navigation/get_navigation.dart';
import 'package:nytimes/helpers/route.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GetMaterialApp(
      getPages: routes,
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      initialRoute: newsScreen,
    );
  }
}
```
# test_coverage

A simple command-line tool to collect test coverage information from
Dart VM tests. It is useful if you need to generate coverage reports
locally during development.

## Usage

Add dev dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  test_coverage: ^0.4.2
```

Run `pub get` to install. Then, in the root of your project run:

```bash
pub run test_coverage
```

Result is saved in `coverage/lcov.info`. If you have `lcov` tool
installed on your system (for Mac it's `brew install lcov`) you can
generate coverage reports using `genhtml` command:

```bash
genhtml -o coverage coverage/lcov.info
# Open in the default browser (mac):
open coverage/index.html
```

## Integrations

Resulting `coverage/lcov.info` file is ready to be consumed by
Codecov command-line tool, so no extra step is needed.

This library was not tested with coveralls yet.

## Generating badge image

![Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajopetersebastian1/nytTechnology_Assessment/test-coverage/master/coverage_badge.svg?sanitize=true)

Coverage badge SVG image is automatically generated and saved to `coverage_badge.svg` in your
project root directory. You can add it to Git and use in README.md on Github as follows:

```md
![Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajopetersebastian1/nytTechnology_Assessment/master/coverage_badge.svg?sanitize=true)
```

If you don't need it you can pass `--no-badge` flag when running test coverage.

## Known limitations

* This library was created to run Dart VM tests. It has not been tested
  and likely won't work for Dart code targeting web platform (compiled
  to JavaScript). There is no need to use this tool for Flutter as it
  allows collecting coverage information with `flutter test --coverage`.

## How it works

The tool performs following steps:

### 1. Generates `test/.test_coverage.dart` file (a "test all" script).

Scans your `test/` directory to find all `*_test.dart` files and creates `test/.test_coverage.dart`
which imports all found test files and runs corresponding `main()` of all tests functions within
the same file (and process), which simplifies collection of coverage information.

It is recommended to add this file to your `.gitignore`.

Below is an example of `test/.test_coverage.dart`:

```dart
// Auto-generated by test_coverage. Do not edit by hand.
// Consider adding this file to your .gitignore.

import 'some_test.dart' as some_test;
import 'nested/other_test.dart' as other_test;
import 'some_other_test.dart' as some_other_test;

void main() {
  some_test.main();
  other_test.main();
  some_other_test.main();
}
```

### 2. Runs the tests

Following command is used to run the tests:

```
dart --pause-isolates-on-exit --enable_asserts --enable-vm-service \
  test/.test_coverage.dart
```

### 3. Collects and formats coverage information

When test execution is completed the tool uses functionality of the
`coverage` package to collect and format coverage report.

Feel free to file feature requests and bug reports at the
[issue tracker][].

### 4. Minimal coverage percentage

Set minimal coverage percentage to pass
`min-coverage` percentage value of coverage.

### 5. See test output
`print-test-output` to show test output.
